# The Land I Live On 

My current life has only been possible due to the land I have settled on: the traditional and unceded territories of many indigenous groups.

Currently, I live in the traditional territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səl̓ílwətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, now known as North Vancouver. I have also lived on Treaty 4 Territory (the lands of the Cree, Saulteaux, Dakota, Nakota, Lakota, and the homeland of the Métis Nations), as well as Treaty 7 Territory (including the Siksika, Piikani, Kainai, Stoney Nakoda, and Tsuut’ina Nations).

I recognize that, as a white settler, my presence is tied to an ongoing history of colonization and displacement. In my personal life, as well as through my work with Socia, I am committed to honoring the Nations whose lands I have lived and worked on by supporting Indigenous sovereignty, listening to and amplifying Indigenous voices, and ensuring that my work contributes to fostering an ethical space of respectful and reciprocal relationships.

One measure I am currently undertaking is active training in the [First Nations principles of OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession)](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/), so that I may better contribute to Indigenous Data Sovereignty. This is just one step of what I consider to be an ongoing journey of listening and learning.
