I am a behavioral scientist interested in leveraging data science and consumer research to help people and organizations make decisions that are aligned with their values.

I am currently working as the Survey and Research Analyst with the Institutional Research and Enrolment Management team at the [College of New Caledonia](https://cnc.bc.ca/).

## As an academic...

I primarily investigate how social, cognitive, and emotional forces intersect to influence judgment and decision-making in consumer and organizational contexts. My current projects examine the impact of explanations on people's reactions to algorithmic decisions, effects of inequality on risk-taking behaviors (e.g., gambling, consumption of security products), and the effects early traumatic events on substance abuse.

## As a "hands-on" practitioner...

I coordinate across internal and external partners to develop meaningful and evidence-based strategies to improve products, services, and organizational functioning. I have worked with the Saskatchewan Brain Injury Association, Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice's Department of Research and Evidence-Based Excellence, and currently volunteer as an organizer for the [North Shore Ultimate League](nsul.ca) - a pick-up ultimate frisbee group in North Vancouver.

## In everything I do...

I am committed to acting with transparency, fairness, and integrity, exemplified in my professional work by using open science practices, and freely sharing materials. My research and analysis materials are available through [GitHub](https://github.com/DallasNovakowski) and the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/p9vhn/).
