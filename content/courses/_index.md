My teaching experience has been focused on introductory marketing and fourth-year consumer behaviour. I have also assisted in a course for marketing management. In these courses, I aim to facilitate critical discussion on the functions, patterns, and stakes of markets and individual decision-making, respectively. These courses have involved engaging with academic literature, developing marketing strategies, and gaining perspectives by inviting community practitioners.
